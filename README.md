In this project, I am work on downloading a database and restoring it on the server. You will then query the database to get customer details like name, phone number, email ID, sales made in a particular month, increase in month-on-month sales and even the total sales made to a particular customer.

Highlights:-

1. Table basics and data types
2. Various SQL operators
3. Various SQL functions

Download the AdventureWorks database from the following location and restore it in your server:

Location:- https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/tag/adventureworks

Adventureworks is s sample database shipped with SQL Server and it can be downloaded from the GitHub site. AdventureWorks has replaced Northwind and Pubs sample databases that were available in SQL Server in 2005. Microsoft keeps updating the sample database as it releases new versions.
